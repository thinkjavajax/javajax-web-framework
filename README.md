#Javajax - Java & Ajax Web Action Framework

JavAjax is a light and fast web action framework that will help you to develop dynamic java web applications in Java, integrated with a strong support for Ajax.

It can easily be integrated in an already developed application/website: on the server side, you just need to configure a new filter and you are ready to call the actions, on the client side it works with your HTML code transparently, no graphical tags are needed, putting in your hand a strong tool to work in Ajax. 

It's key features are:

* Strong support for Ajax: write your Action and call its methods via Ajax or in page navigation mode trasparently through a generated Javascript Action API
* Strong, multi-level data validation performed at method level - data type, regular expression matching, min/max length/value, compulsoriness
* Automatic Request parameters/method parameters mapping
* Automatic Bean population with parameters from request
* Bean pre-population strategy: instantiate or pre-load the Bean you want to be populated
* Bean post-population validation through expressions
* Minimal jsp tags use, pure html form and elements: no need of framework dependent graphical tags
* Support for Action and Method level security, basic security is based on roles as defined by J2EE standards, or you can easily implement your own
* Automatic error reporting with field highlighting, both with Ajax and page navigation methods
* Easy localization support through a multi-level resource bundle strategy
* Javascript based on prototype.js or jquery assures the same behaviour with the most diffused browsers.
* Support for Action call chaining

And much more...
